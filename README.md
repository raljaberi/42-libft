#libft

**libft** is a custom C library that reimplements essential functions from the standard C library. This project, part of the 42 curriculum, focuses on understanding low-level programming, memory management, and function implementation. By recreating functions like `strlen`, `malloc`, and `atoi`, it enhances proficiency in C and lays the foundation for future projects.
